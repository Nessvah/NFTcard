## My process

I started structuring first the html and struggled a bit with the new semantic HTML markup since I didn't know exactly what to use since it was just a card. 

The main difficulty was positioning and centering the elements, even with flexbox I dind't knew exactly how it worked. 

Another major difficulty was the hover state on the image. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### Continued development

Need to continue to practice the basics for html and css specially about positioning and layouts.
